# Tutorial Documentation for Lab 1: Excel Basics for Data Analytics

### **Project Name:**

**Excel Basics for Data Analytics**

---

## **Introduction:**

In this lab, you will work as a junior data analyst for a retail company. Your task is to clean, manipulate, and analyze sales data using Microsoft Excel. The dataset provided contains sales data such as dates, sales regions, product categories, and sales amounts. You will perform tasks like data entry, using formulas, sorting/filtering, data cleaning, and basic visualizations to present your findings.

### **Step 1: Understanding the Dataset**

Create or download a simple Excel dataset with columns like:

- **Date**: The date of the sale.
- **Region**: Sales region (East, West, North, South).
- **Product**: Product category (Electronics, Furniture, Clothing).
- **Sales Amount**: The amount of each sale.

**Sample Dataset:**

| Date | Region | Product | Sales Amount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-01-15 | East | Electronics | 150 |
| 2024-01-16 | West | Furniture | 200 |
| 2024-01-17 | North | Clothing | 100 |
| 2024-01-18 | South | Electronics | 300 |

### **Step 2: Entering and Formatting Data**

1. **Open Excel** and create a new worksheet.
2. Manually enter the sales data (as shown in the table above).
3. **Format the cells**:
    - Select the **Date** column, and format it as **Date**.
    - Select the **Sales Amount** column, format it as **Currency** or **Number** (with two decimal places).
4. **Bold the headers** (Date, Region, Product, Sales Amount) to distinguish them from the rest of the data.

### **Step 3: Using Basic Formulas**

1. **Sum the Sales Amount**:
    - Click in an empty cell (e.g., E2).
    - Use the `SUM` formula to calculate the total sales:
        
        ```
        =SUM(D2:D5)
        
        ```
        
    - Press **Enter** to display the total sales.
2. **Calculate the Average Sales**:
    - In another cell, use the `AVERAGE` formula to find the average sales:
        
        ```
        =AVERAGE(D2:D5)
        
        ```
        
3. **Find Maximum and Minimum Sales**:
    - Use the `MAX` and `MIN` functions to identify the highest and lowest sales amounts:
        
        ```
        =MAX(D2:D5)
        =MIN(D2:D5)
        
        ```

### **Step 4: Sorting and Filtering Data**

1. **Sorting Data**:
    - Select the entire dataset.
    - Go to the **Data** tab, click on **Sort**.
    - Sort the data by **Sales Amount** from largest to smallest.

1. **Filtering Data**:
    - Select the header row.
    - Go to the **Data** tab, click on **Filter**.
    - Use the filter to only display rows where the **Region** is "East."

### **Step 5: Data Cleaning**

1. **Check for missing data**:
    - If any cells under **Sales Amount** are blank, fill them with `0` or "N/A."
2. **Correct spelling errors**:
    - Review the **Region** column and correct any misspelled entries (e.g., if "Nort" is entered instead of "North").

### **Step 6: Creating Basic Charts**

1. **Create a Bar Chart for Sales by Region**:
    - Highlight the **Region** and **Sales Amount** columns.
    - Go to the **Insert** tab, select **Bar Chart**.
    - Excel will generate a bar chart showing sales for each region.

1. **Create a Line Chart for Sales Over Time**:
    - Highlight the **Date** and **Sales Amount** columns.
    - Insert a **Line Chart** to visualize how sales have changed over time.

### **Step 7: Applying Conditional Formatting**

1. **Highlight the Sales Amount column**.
2. Go to the **Home** tab, click **Conditional Formatting**.
3. Create rules:
    - Values greater than 200 should be highlighted in green.
    - Values less than 150 should be highlighted in red.
